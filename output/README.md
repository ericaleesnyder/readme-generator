## Description

My motivation behind this application was to simplify the process of creating README files for future projects. 

I built this application to create README files based on the user input that inquirer gathers. 

The fact that this project will do the heavy lifting of README creations for the user means that more time and effort can be spent paying attention to the actual functionality of the application. It also ensures that for each application created, a quality README is produced. 

Through this process I learned just how helpful linking multiple JavaScript files can be when trying to keep code clean and concise. 

The deployed version of the application can be found at:
